# Drafts Feed
WordPress Plugin, that add a new Feed for drafts and a dashboard widget to list all drafts from all authors.

## Description
We are already working with four authors at [WPEngineer](http://wpengineer.com) – so it's quite useful to have a feed for drafts and everybody can look at it. If someone is writing a new post and saves as draft everybody get immediately notified via feed.

There is also the possibility to get notified via email, but I thought it's more convenient to let everybody know about new drafts through our feed reader. That's why I checked out how to create your own feed. With the help of the loop you can do quite a lot, as you can see in our previous post „Customize Your WordPress-Feeds“.

You are welcome to use the following small Plugin (download link at the end of this post) or use the displayed code below to create your own feed.

Feed doesn't have an access protection – that makes reading with several online tools easy and simple.

The Plugin creates a feed, which is available at `http://example.com/?feed=drafts` or with active permalinks on `http://example.com/feed/drafts/`.
You can change this string on the var `feed_slug`.
